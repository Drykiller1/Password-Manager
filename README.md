# Password-Manager
his program saves for you site as a name, password and email
you can search for website you has signed to so it will display the info.

for ex.
if i signed and entered the site "youtube"
and I search "you" it will show me that maybe I wanted to search for "youtube" or multiple choices if there are any saved.
